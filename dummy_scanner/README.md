# dummy_scanner
The `dummy_scanner/` directory contains dummy scripts that simulate the behavior of the normal scripts found in the `scanner/` directory. These dummy scripts are used in place of the normal scanner code when the main node web application is run with the dummy flag.

## Dependencies
The code from the `dummy_scanner/` directory only requires:
- python + numpy module

The following are NOT required:
- any physical hardware (sweep sensor or raspberry pi)
- installation of `libsweep` or `sweeppy`
